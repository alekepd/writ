# (w)rit

A package to write and read array data to and from disk using an iterable interface.

## Warning

This package is experimental. Interfaces are subject to change and tests are
far from complete. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Install the `writ` package from source by calling `pip install .`, repository's
root directory. 

Note that individual readers or writers may require other libraries (e.g., 
`h5py`).

## Reading and Writing

Interfaces are given for reading data, and interfaces for writing data are
planned. Note that while the modules are written to clearly state requirements,
these tools are developed for file formats as they are needed.

### Example usage

See the individual modules for information on usage.
